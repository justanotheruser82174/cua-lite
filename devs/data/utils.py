"""Row helpers used only by the ``devs/`` data tooling, not by ``lite/``.

Split out of ``lite/data/staging.py``: both functions here have ZERO consumers
under ``lite/`` and are called only by the dev-side annotation/migration
scripts, so they live on the dev side of the boundary. Everything they build on
— ``coerce_image_paths``, ``to_plain``, ``resolve_artifact_path`` — stays in
``lite.data.staging`` and is imported back from there; ``devs`` → ``lite`` is
the normal direction.

Why ``devs/data/`` and not a neutral ``devs/utils.py``: the two PERMANENT
consumers are the annotation filters, ``devs/data/lite.osworld/filter.py`` and
``devs/data/webgym/filter.py``, both under this directory. The third consumer,
``devs/migration/upgrade.py``, reaches across subtrees — that is expected, not a
smell, because migration is temporary: ``devs/migration/AGENTS.md`` calls itself
"a **one-time repair of old ``Lite.*`` rollout inputs**, not a general data
pipeline". Shaping the layout around a subtree scheduled for deletion would be
backwards; when migration goes, this module is already where its real owners
live and nothing has to move a second time.

``devs`` is NOT an installed package (``pyproject.toml`` ships ``lite*`` only),
so an importer has to put the repo root on ``sys.path`` first — see the
``_REPO_ROOT`` bootstrap in ``devs/data/lite.osworld/filter.py``,
``devs/data/webgym/filter.py`` and ``devs/migration/upgrade.py``.

Use:
    _REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[<depth to repo root>]
    if str(_REPO_ROOT) not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, str(_REPO_ROOT))

    Why it is needed at all: a filter drops a STEP, not a picture, so without
    this the row keeps every image while the surviving messages reference a
    non-contiguous subset. That is internally consistent -- ``export_sft``
    resolves it correctly -- but it publishes orphan images that no message
    shows, which is confusing in a dataset viewer and pure waste on disk

    from the rollout+filter path, and every preproc dataset had zero]`.

    Returns ``(images, messages)`` with orphans removed and indices contiguous.
