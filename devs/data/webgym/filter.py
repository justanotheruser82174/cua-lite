"""WebGym data-collection filter — the SINGLE filtering step before staging/SFT.

Dedicated to the webgym GPT→small-VLM distillation pipeline (a standalone dev
script, not an importable module). ALL trajectory filtering lives here, so it's
explicit in one place — ``lite.data.hf.stage`` no longer applies any default
filter (its default behavior is now "stage everything"). Jobs:
  (1) drop env-agnostic no-op actions (``screenshot``/``wait``) from each turn;
  (2) ``--drop-failed`` — drop unsuccessful trajectories (``episode_return < 1.0``),
      the success filter that used to be ``stage``'s hidden default;
  (3) opt-in drop of whole footgun trajectories that hurt the student
      (F1/F2/F3/F6 + ``serp_only``/``search_flail``);
  (4) ``--drop-captcha`` — drop trajectories that hit a bot-verification / captcha
      wall (mostly redundant with ``--drop-failed`` — blocked pages usually score
      0 — but catches the ~8% of successes that detoured through a verification page).
  (5) ``--drop-unsubmitted`` — drop trajectories whose final answer was never
      submitted via a top-level ``response`` tool call with non-empty text. The
      answer must flow through ``response`` for the grader to see it; an
      unsubmitted trajectory scores 0 and teaches the student to end without
      answering. (Redundant with ``--drop-failed`` on the success set — these
      always score 0 — but an explicit guard for staging without ``--drop-failed``.)
  (6) ``--drop-illposed-task`` — drop trajectories whose TASK instruction is a
      degenerate/underspecified template with unfilled placeholders ("...a specific
      keyword ... within a specific category ... for a specific date range"). These
      are data-generation bugs, not policy failures — the model's only correct move
      is to refuse, so they teach nothing. Best applied as a PRE-ROLLOUT task filter
      to avoid wasting rollouts; here it also drops any that slipped through.

  NOTE on web search (validated on r1 data): from a datacenter egress IP the search
  ENGINES (DuckDuckGo / Google / Bing) intermittently IP-block the search REQUEST
  (the results page errors with "anomaly"/reCAPTCHA even though the homepage loads),
  while individual content sites vary. We deliberately KEEP *productive* search
  (search -> click a result -> read; 9-34% of successes) and only drop the
  degenerate ``serp_only`` (search, never click through). A blanket
  ``--drop-search-goto`` is available but NOT recommended for 8B/32B — it kills the
  learnable research skill. The durable fix for search flakiness is infra (clean
  egress IP / proxy), not filtering.

Some teachers (notably GPT computer-use) emit actions that are genuine no-ops in
*any* env and only waste a step:

  * ``screenshot`` — the gym auto-captures an observation after every step, so an
    explicit screenshot does nothing.
  * ``wait`` — advances no env state.

Training a student to imitate these teaches it to waste steps. This tool removes
them from the recorded CUA-lite ``tool_calls`` and drops any assistant turn that
becomes empty. In current ``role:"tool"`` logs, only the orphaned tool results
for that dropped turn are removed; in rows without ``role:"tool"`` results, the
paired preceding user observation is removed. The cleaned rollout log-root is
otherwise written in the same shape that ``export_sft`` consumes.

The default set is deliberately env-agnostic (only universally-useless actions).
Env-specific no-ops are NOT stripped by default — pass ``--actions`` to add them
when you know the target env treats them as no-ops. On webgym those are the
canonical desktop actions its action translator cannot execute
(``cursor_position``/``hold_key``/``key_down``/``key_up``/``mouse_down``/
``mouse_up``; see ``quality_check._NOOP``).

``--actions`` matches on the action NAME only. Argument-qualified variants are
therefore NOT expressible: a double click is canonical ``click`` with ``clicks=2``,
and ``--actions click`` would strip every click. If you ever need to strip one of
those, add an argument predicate here rather than widening ``--actions``.

Dropping a no-op-only turn is safe: a no-op doesn't change env state, so the next
observation already matches what followed it. The image that turn showed is then
referenced by nothing, so the output row is COMPACTED — the orphan is dropped and
the surviving indices are renumbered ``0..N-1`` by ``compact_row_images``
(``devs/data/utils.py``), which
rewrites the ``images`` array and every ``{"type":"image","index": N}`` part in
one step and asserts the result is dense. (It used to be left in place as
"harmless"; it is harmless to ``export_sft``, which resolves sparse indices
correctly, but it publishes a picture no message shows.) When a leading
preceding-observation user message is dropped, the latest observation image is
excluded from carried content; text, metadata, and earlier indexed reference
image parts are preserved.

Run (host):
    python devs/data/webgym/filter.py \
        --log-root .logs/rollout/gpt_webgym_collect \
        --out      .logs/rollout/gpt_webgym_collect_clean \
        --drop-failed --drop-loops --drop-serp-only \
        --drop-captcha --drop-unsubmitted --drop-illposed-task
    # then stage the --out root (stage no longer filters): see
    #   devs/data/webgym/AGENTS.md §5 / docs/examples/rollout_to_hf.md.
    # tests: uv run pytest devs/data/webgym/tests/test_webgym_filter.py

Default stripped set is the env-agnostic ``screenshot,wait`` pair; override with
``--actions a,b,c`` when you intentionally want to include webgym-specific
unsupported actions.

        Same-brand subdomains and same-domain deep/API links are KEPT.

        task that degenerates into multi-engine search; low-value for a grounded student).
      * ``search_flail`` — STRICT (2B): the trajectory **bounces search engines (>=2 distinct) or

      * ``serp_only`` — the trajectory **searches but never clicks through to a real page**
        (snippet-scraping / SERP thrashing, e.g. 126677: same query on 3 engines, 0 clicks, then

      * ``illposed_task`` — the task instruction is a degenerate underspecified
