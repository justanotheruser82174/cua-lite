"""Provider-call retry policy for the agent model families.

Owns the one capped exponential backoff formula the GPT and Claude agents wrap
around their paid provider entrypoints (``litellm.aresponses`` /
``litellm.acompletion``). Retry policy is runtime behavior — latency, cost, and
failure visibility — so it lives with the provider-independent agent runtime,
not in the low-semantic ``lite.utils`` namespace.

This module is agent-side only. ``lite/gym`` never imports ``lite/agents``, so
env-side judges keep their own local retry policy.
