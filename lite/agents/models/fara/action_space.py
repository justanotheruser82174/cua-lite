"""
Fara-1.0 Action Space

Wire format: a single ``computer_use`` tool with an ``action`` parameter —
mirrors the reference ``fara/src/fara/_prompts.py::FaraComputerUse``
byte-for-byte (11-action web-browsing enum). Fara is a Qwen2.5-VL fine-tune,
so this shares Qwen2.5-VL's conventions:

  * The schema description contains the placeholder
    ``{display_width_px}x{display_height_px}``; the adapter substitutes the
    actual smart-resized image dims (factor=28) per render.
  * Coordinates ARE the resized-image pixels — no normalization here. The
    adapter rescales between cua-lite [0, 1000] and pixel-in-resized using
    ``self._current_image_size`` cached during ``render_step``.

Fara adds four web-native actions on top of the desktop verbs:
``visit_url`` / ``web_search`` / ``history_back`` / ``pause_and_memorize_fact``.
``visit_url`` ↔ cua-lite ``goto`` and ``history_back`` ↔ ``back`` map onto the
canonical browser-nav verbs (:class:`LiteBrowserNavToolSet`); ``web_search`` becomes a
``goto`` of the Bing results URL (matching the reference, which visits Bing);
``pause_and_memorize_fact`` has no browser effect and passes through by name
(a benign no-op on the env — the fact lives in the assistant thoughts).

        * Make sure to click any buttons, links, icons, etc with the cursor tip in the center of the element. Don't click boxes on their edges unless asked.
