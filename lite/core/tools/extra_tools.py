"""Core tool sets for env-owned extra tools.

``env_kwargs.extra_tools`` selects these tool sets. They need no action-batch
wrapper, coordinate space, or action key; ``env_kwargs.valid_actions`` belongs
to the action-space layer instead.

Each catalog class is the source of truth for names and schemas. Singular
``get_tool_schema(name)`` returns ``None`` when a catalog does not carry a name;
plural ``get_tool_schemas(include=...)`` requires every requested name to be in
the catalog. Canonical nested extra-tool schemas are emitted in declaration
order.

Core declares only canonical names such as ``response`` and ``terminate``.
Model-family dialect spellings live on the corresponding action spaces. The
finish-tool descriptions intentionally cross-reference each other so an agent
knows which tool submits an answer and which ends the episode without answer
text.

Runtime-internal finish calls are recognized beside ``LiteFinishToolSet`` as well:
``core.tools.calls`` owns the internal-stop annotation, while this module owns
the finish catalog that gives the annotation meaning.

Usage:
    from lite.core.tools.extra_tools import LiteFinishToolSet

    schemas = LiteFinishToolSet.get_tool_schemas(include=["response"])
    schema = LiteFinishToolSet.get_tool_schema("terminate")
    is_finish = "terminate" in LiteFinishToolSet.get_tool_names()

Run:
    uv run pytest tests/core/tools/action_space/test_tool_catalog.py \
        tests/core/tools/test_extra_tool_schema_goldens.py -q
