"""LiteContainerBase — the ONE contract for a DEDICATED per-episode container handle.

Run: not directly. Subclassed by the env container adapters (osworld,
osworld_2, androidworld, androidlab, mobileworld).

Layer 3 of the framework: the concrete
container *handle* under the capability layer. The base does two jobs:

1. **Declares the interface** the framework types against — ``name`` /
   ``api_port`` (subclass dataclass fields), ``base_url`` / ``start()``
   (abstract: host/port shape and boot pipeline genuinely differ per env).
2. **Provides the invariants every env used to hand-roll** (and drift on):
   the process-wide tracked registry + atexit backstop, normalized port
   ownership (``_ports_owned``), and a template-method :meth:`destroy` that
   is idempotent, never raises, and always runs its cleanup tail.

Subclasses override :meth:`_pre_destroy` ONLY — never :meth:`destroy` itself
(overriding the template would silently lose its guarantees; the ``release``
alias dispatches to the template, which dispatches to your hook).

A new container env therefore writes: a ``@dataclass`` subclass with its
fields, ``start()``, and ``base_url`` — teardown, registry, atexit and port
release are inherited and cannot be copied wrong.
