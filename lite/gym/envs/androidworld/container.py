"""Docker-container-per-worker emulator container + factory for androidworld.

Each container is a self-contained androidworld env: it hosts the
emulator AND the env_launcher-managed Python env AND the a11y gRPC
server (via ``docker/server.py``). Because every flow that needs
container→host reverse connectivity stays inside the container's
network namespace, this works on rootless docker even with the
``slirp4netns --disable-host-loopback`` default.

Design:

  - Network: default bridge network. Each container gets its own
    private net ns. The emulator's console/adb/gRPC always bind the
    same in-container ports (:attr:`_CPORT_CONSOLE` etc.) — no
    cross-container port contention, no need for a centralized
    locking pool. Only one port is exposed to the host:
    :attr:`api_port`, mapped via ``docker -p`` to the in-container
    server's :attr:`_CPORT_API`. That's the single channel the host
    process uses to drive the env.

  - Adb (Pattern Y): the in-container env-server hands env_launcher
    the in-container adb binary path directly, so all adb traffic
    stays inside the container's network namespace. The Android
    emulator's adbd binds 127.0.0.1 in-container; routing through
    docker exec sidesteps that completely. Host-side code talks to
    the env via HTTP-RPC, not adb.

  - In-container env-server: ``docker/server.py`` (FastAPI, baked
    into the image as ``/usr/local/bin/server.py``) hosts env_launcher
    + a TaskEval instance. The host's main.py drives it via HTTP-RPC
    (``_RemoteEnv`` / ``_RemoteTask`` proxies). a11y_grpc_wrapper's
    reverse gRPC server is created in that same in-container Python
    process, so the a11y forwarder APK's call to ``10.0.2.2:<port>``
    terminates at the container's own loopback. No host loopback ever
    needed.

  - Boot: ``-snapshot default_boot -no-snapshot-save`` — Quick Boot from
    the ``default_boot`` snapshot baked into the image at build time
    (``docker/apps.sh`` runs ``adb emu avd snapshot save default_boot``
    after installing the apps). We deliberately do NOT pass ``-read-only``
    (it would restore RAM but drop the userdata overlay on snapshot
    reload). A snapshot RAM-restore is ~5-20 s vs a true cold boot's
    60-120 s; see ``start()`` for the exact ``emulator`` flags.

Container lifecycle: **spawn per acquire, destroy on release** by default
(``_MAX_RESETS_PER_CONTAINER`` / ``max_resets_per_container`` = 0 — a
deliberate cleanliness tradeoff). The first spawn still pays ~35 s (boot
the snapshot off disk + the readiness pipeline); set
``max_resets_per_container`` >= 1 to reuse a live container across
episodes via ``reset_snapshot()`` (~5 s snapshot reload — see ``main.py``).

Port allocation: only the host-side :attr:`api_port` is dynamic; goes
through ``lite/gym/utils/backend/ports.py``'s shared flock + reservation
file. See the port-range map at the top of that file.

Rebuild semantics
-----------------
Image is built from ``lite/gym/envs/androidworld/docker/``. Changes
to ANY file under that directory — ``Dockerfile``, ``apps.sh``,
``server.py``, pip-installed deps — require
``bash lite/gym/envs/androidworld/scripts/install.sh rebuild``
to land in spawned containers. Changes to host-side code in this
file or ``main.py`` (the ``_RemoteEnv`` / ``_RemoteTask`` proxies,
the env-server orchestration) take effect on the next env-server
restart without rebuilding the image.

Run (smoke, requires ``cua-lite/androidworld:latest`` built via
``scripts/install.sh``):

    uv run python -c "
    from lite.gym.envs.androidworld.container import AndroidWorldContainerFactory
    factory = AndroidWorldContainerFactory(task_id='SmokeTest')
    c = factory.acquire()
    print('booted:', c.name, 'api:', c.base_url)
    print('packages installed:', len(c.adb_shell('pm', 'list', 'packages', '-3').splitlines()))
    c.destroy()
    "
