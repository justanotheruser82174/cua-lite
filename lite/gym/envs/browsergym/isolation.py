"""Shared-backend isolation metadata for WA/VWA.

WebArena / VisualWebArena back EVERY task with one shared, mutable docker
stack. The env-server's GENERIC conflict gate
(:mod:`lite.gym.remote.conflict`) serializes writers per stack by reading
``metadata.others["conflict_keys"]`` + ``metadata.others["mutating"]`` (an
opt-in, server-mode-only contract carried in ``others`` rather than typed
core fields). This module derives those two values at registration time
(``conflict_keys_and_mutating``) and provides the ``restore_backend`` hook
the server dispatches after a writer closes.

Kept separate from ``main.py`` (the env wrapper) so the isolation concern
is one discrete, swappable unit — symmetric with the server's
``conflict.py``. The server stays env-agnostic; all WA-specific policy
(sites → coarse key, write classification, how to reset the stack) lives
here.
