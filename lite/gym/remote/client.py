"""HTTP client for a remote env server.

Drop-in replacement for a locally-instantiated :class:`LiteBaseEnv`:
forwards ``reset`` / ``step`` / ``close`` to an env server over HTTP.
Used when ``CUA_LITE_ENV_SERVER_URL`` is set (or ``env_server_url`` is
passed explicitly into ``gym.make``).

The wire format is defined in the sibling :mod:`lite.gym.remote.server`;
``scripts/serve_env.py`` is just a thin launcher for that module.

Run (smoke test, requires a running serve_env.py):
    CUA_LITE_ENV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:30100 \\
    CUA_LITE_ENV_SERVER_TOKEN=xxx \\

# httpx connection-pool sizing — tuned for 32+ concurrent rollouts (the

# keepalives, which is marginal on loopback (<1 ms/handshake) but

#: How long this pool is willing to hand out an idle keep-alive connection.
#:
#: **PUBLIC — half of a cross-process invariant.** The env-server's uvicorn
#: ``timeout_keep_alive`` MUST be strictly greater than this value, so that the
#: *client* always retires a pooled connection before the *server* closes it.
#: The server side derives its timeout from this constant
#: (``lite.gym.remote.alive.SERVER_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SEC``) so the two
#: cannot drift apart; ``tests/gym/remote/test_keep_alive_contract.py`` pins
#: the ordering.
#:
#: Why the ordering matters: uvicorn's ``timeout_keep_alive`` defaults to 5 s.
#: With that default the server closes idle connections this pool still
#: considers live, so any agent think-time above 5 s between two RPCs races the
#: close. httpcore usually notices the FIN (``has_expired()`` polls the socket
#: for readability) and dials a fresh connection, but when the close lands
#: *after* that check and *before* the response — which a busy single-threaded
#: uvicorn loop makes common, since the keep-alive callback is deferred behind
#: whatever else the loop is running — the request dies in
#: ``_receive_response_headers`` with ``httpx.ReadError``. ``/step`` is
#: deliberately not retried (see below), so that kills the episode.

            the eager POST /instances below is somehow skipped. The
            authoritative metadata that ``self.metadata`` returns comes
            from the server's create response (env_kwargs-shaped).
        token: Bearer token. Falls back to ``$CUA_LITE_ENV_SERVER_TOKEN``.
        session_id: Falls back to ``$SESSION_ID`` (matches the cleanup/session
            label used by ``scripts/train/slime/launch.sh``).
        timeout: httpx request timeout for every call. Default 600s — env
            ``reset()`` on osworld can take several minutes. ``gym.make``
            passes ``max(reset_timeout, step_timeout) + 60`` (660 s at the
            default ``reset_timeout``), which covers ONE server-side reset,

    Mental-model parity with direct mode: ``__init__`` synchronously POSTs
    ``/instances`` so that, by the time ``LiteEnvClient(...)`` returns, the
    server-side env has been constructed and ``self.metadata`` reflects the
    LIVE env_kwargs-shaped metadata (extra_tools / valid_actions / etc).
    This matches direct mode where ``gym.make()`` returns an env whose
    ``metadata`` property is immediately authoritative. POST /instances
    only commits an admission slot and runs the env's ``__init__`` — no
    physical resource (browser / docker / emulator) is allocated until

        Every retry here re-sends the SAME POST, so both retry classes below turn
        on one property: ``replay_safe`` — may this request be sent again when we
        cannot prove the first one didn't take effect? ``/reset`` is replay-safe (a
        second reset re-establishes the same initial state); ``/step`` is not
        (without server-side request-id dedupe a replay can apply the same env
        action twice while the trajectory records one action).

        The two classes differ in how they're BOUNDED:

        * **HTTP 503** (server-typed capacity exhaustion): honor
          ``Retry-After`` exactly; loop until either a non-503 lands or the
          wall-clock deadline ``_CLIENT_503_DEADLINE_S`` would be exceeded by
          the next hinted sleep. On deadline: raise
          :class:`CapacityExhausted` (typed for the training loop's
          group-redraw filter).
        * **Transport drop** (:func:`~lite.gym.utils.backend.rpc.may_reissue`):
          exp-backoff per ``_client_retry_delay_s``, bounded by attempt count
          (``_CLIENT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS``) since these don't carry a server
          hint to follow. This hop's transport is httpx, so in practice that is
          the ``NetworkError`` family, ``RemoteProtocolError``, and
          ``ConnectTimeout`` (the one timeout that proves no request was sent).

        * **Client-side read timeout** (``httpx.ReadTimeout``): NOT a transport
          failure and NOT retried, regardless of ``replay_safe`` — the server is
          likely still executing the call and still holding its ``reset_sema``
          slot, so a re-POST stacks work on an already-slow server. Converted to a typed
          :class:`~lite.gym.remote.errors.RemoteCallTimeout`, which documents
          the client-vs-server budget asymmetry and tells the caller to
          ``close()`` before re-making.

        Other 4xx/5xx surface immediately — they're not retryable.
