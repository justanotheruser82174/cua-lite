"""Composed container reconcile-view + its docker-ps/rm primitives.

The ``live_ids`` / ``reap`` a container-backed env-server backend exposes, as a
standalone object container ``EnvServices`` *compose* (hold-and-delegate), NOT a
mixin they inherit — composition has no MRO and avoids the
``class X(EnvServices, …)`` shadow footgun. ``lite.osworld`` / ``lite.demo`` /
``androidworld`` / ``androidlab`` all share this one body.

  * :meth:`ContainerReaper.live_ids` — the RUNNING container names this run owns;
    the framework computes ghosts (``tracked − live``) from it. **Fails closed**:
    raises :class:`~lite.gym.errors.ReconcileProbeError` (the reconcile loop catches
    it and skips this cycle) on any ``docker ps`` failure — never returns ``None`` —
    so a docker hiccup never mass-false-ghosts live instances (a latent bug in the old
    code, which treated a failed scan as "nothing running" → ghosted everything).
  * :meth:`ContainerReaper.reap` — ``docker rm -f`` of orphan containers (live,
    NOT in ``in_use``, older than the orphan age guard), capped + quarantine-backed.

**Scoping is by ``server_port`` alone.** The server's listen port already
isolates co-resident servers; within one server, every container is that
server's to reap regardless of which client (token_hash) created it — the
framework's exact-match on ``in_use`` keeps any live instance's container safe.
A port-scoped ``docker ps`` catches strict and passthrough containers uniformly
without relying on token-hash sentinels.

The low-level docker-ps / docker-rm primitives (``_docker_ps_*``, ``_try_orphan_rm``,
``_prune_quarantine``) + their tuning constants live at module scope below — they
were a separate ``docker_drift`` module, folded in here as its only consumer.

WHY THIS LIVES UNDER ``remote/`` even though env modules import it directly.
The public imports are :class:`ContainerServices` and
:class:`SingletonContainerServices` — ``EnvServices`` subclasses, i.e. the
env-server integration surface. The docker primitives are module-private, and
``tests/gym/remote/test_reaper.py::test_env_facing_surface_is_the_two_services_classes``
fails if a primitive or whole-module alias escapes. Every public method is typed
on :class:`lite.gym.remote.scope.ServerScope`, and the pair ``live_ids`` /
``reap`` is :class:`lite.gym.remote.reconcile.ReconcileView`. Moving this under
``utils/backend`` would point that package at ``lite.gym.remote`` and separate
a protocol from its implementation.

Not to be confused with :mod:`lite.gym.utils.backend.reaper` — same word, two
concepts. That one is a parametrized ``atexit`` sweep of a process-local
registry on interpreter exit; this one is the env-server's steady-state,
``server_port``-scoped reconcile of the docker host.

Run: not directly. Composed by container-backed env ``EnvServices`` objects;
the docker subprocess paths are exercised by the live/stress suites.
