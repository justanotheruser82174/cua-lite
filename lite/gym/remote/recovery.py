"""
Env-server framework recovery / reconcile / shutdown sweeps.

These are the per-env-id lifecycle sweeps the env-server runs around a process
lifetime — boot recovery (:func:`recover_all`), the steady-state drift loop
(:func:`reconcile_all`, ~120 s timer), and graceful teardown
(:func:`shutdown_all`). Each iterates the registered leaf env-ids, dispatches to
the env's services object (:class:`lite.gym.services.EnvServices`), and
isolates per-env exceptions so one env's docker hiccup can't abort the cycle.

Lives under ``lite.gym.remote`` (server-only surface) rather than in the
registry: it depends on the registry's spec table but the registry does not
depend on it. Imported lazily from :mod:`lite.gym.remote.server` so registry and
remote/server never form an import cycle.

Usage:
    from lite.gym.remote.recovery import reconcile_all, recover_all, shutdown_all
