"""FastAPI app that exposes :class:`LiteBaseEnv` over HTTP.

Library half of the env-server split:
  - This module: schemas + state + endpoints + idle TTL reaper + auth.
  - Thin launcher: [`scripts/serve_env.py`](/scripts/serve_env.py) — argparse +
    ``uvicorn.run(make_app(State(...)))``.

Endpoints (all require ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` when
``make_app(state, token=...)`` is given a non-None token; open when
``token=None`` for solo-dev). Three disjoint resource trees: ``/envs/*``
for **env types** (registry probes — read-heavy), ``/instances/*``
for **live sessions** (RPC — write-heavy), and ``/admin/*`` for
**cluster introspection** (cross-token, operator-side).

Admission — three independent layers + a structural daemon lock,
each emitting a typed HTTP 503 + ``Retry-After`` that the client
retries (:class:`lite.gym.remote.client.LiteEnvClient._post_with_retry`).
The server's exception handler attributes every 503 to one layer via
the ``layer`` field on :class:`~lite.gym.errors.CapacityExhausted`,
counted at ``cua_lite_admission_503_total{layer="..."}``.

  L1  emergency   — host RAM / load via psutil; pluggable per server
                    via :func:`~lite.gym.remote.admission.register_emergency_check`.
                    Dynamic — re-checked on every POST /instances.
  L2  capacity    — in-flight env cap. Auto-derives from vCPU and RAM at boot
                    (MIN(vCPU × 4, RAM_GB / 4) clamped to [4, 512]);
                    operator may override with ``--max-live-envs``.
                    Static at runtime.
  L3  env_internal — each env raises ``CapacityExhausted`` from its
                     own ``reset()`` / pool acquire when its bounded
                     internal resource is full (mobilegym browser pool,
                     port range, OmniBoxes slot, ...). Env-specific cap.
  docker_sema     — structural, not admission: process-wide semaphore
                    serializing ``docker run`` calls so docker-backed
                    envs don't trample the daemon. Raises L3-shape
                    503 on timeout. See
                    :func:`~lite.gym.remote.admission.docker_create_slot`.

L1+L2 live in this module; L3 is per-env (see each env's main.py);
docker_sema is shared by androidworld / androidlab / lite.osworld
via :mod:`lite.gym.remote.admission`. The framework is env-agnostic:
this file never branches on env_id, never reads env-specific config.

# containers' port forwards long enough that both inner attempts fail.

#   * a recoverable storm (bulk-rm / brief daemon stall) — recovers within
#     2-6 s, so 3-4 attempts catches it; or
#   * true container death (in-container uvicorn gone) — never recovers, and the
#     wasted ~14 s saves the rollout client's downstream ``--max-attempts``
#     budget (~3 min per fresh container spawn) for the recoverable case.
# 14 s ≪ the ``httpx`` client timeout (600 s), so this is transparent to the
# client beyond a slightly slower successful response. Not tunable: the two env
# vars that used to set these were read under the same names in ``client.py``
