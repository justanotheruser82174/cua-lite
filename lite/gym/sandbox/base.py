"""
SandboxBaseEnv — Base Computer Use benchmark environment.

Self-contained task environment with a gym-like reset/step/close interface.
Host↔container transport is **exec-stdio** (lite/gym/sandbox/exec_stdio/):
one persistent ``docker exec -i`` JSON-lines session per container, talking
to a lean in-container server (xdotool/ffmpeg/shell).

Lifecycle is constructor/soft aware: construction sets immutable post-boot
fields (container config, callbacks, display resolution, etc.) and ``bind``
stamps task identity + soft kwargs.
``boot()`` is idempotent and task-independent (reads only constructor fields).
``reset()`` composes the two. The env-server cold-constructs the caller's real
key through ``gym.make``. Direct-mode ``EnvCls(task=t, **kwargs)`` partitions
kwargs at the env class and ends up running constructor-state setup + ``bind``
under the hood.

#:   in ``lite/train/rollout/core/engine.py``), and ``close()`` spends up to 30 s

        **Single entry point for soft state.** Direct mode and server cold
        construction both call the concrete env's explicit ``__init__``; this
        class sets constructor state, then calls ``bind`` exactly once.
        Subclasses with additional soft kwargs MUST
        extend the signature with their own named params and call
        ``super().bind(task, max_steps=max_steps)`` once — see
        ``LiteOsworldEnv.bind`` for the pattern.

        ``seed`` is a UNIVERSAL harness-injected soft kwarg (``group_shared_seed`` /
        ``--env-kwargs seed=...``), so the BASE signature accepts it — deterministic sandbox
        tasks ignore it; subclasses that use it (``LiteOsworldEnv`` → ``_noise_seed``) override
        and consume it. An env using this base ``bind`` directly (e.g. ``lite.demo``) must stay
        callable with the harness's standard soft kwargs.

        **Unconditional assignment**: signature defaults are the SINGLE
        source of truth for what each soft kwarg defaults to. Inside
        the body, every soft field gets assigned exactly once per
        call — never ``if x is not None: self._x = x``. Because direct and server
        paths route here, the body always runs with the caller's exact value
        (None included), so the two modes produce byte-equal state.

        ``task=None`` is the no-task default used when construction seeds
        soft defaults before a task is bound. In that case the body still runs fully —
        ``self._task`` ends up ``None`` and ``self._max_steps`` takes
        the explicit ``max_steps`` kwarg. ``setup_fn`` work that
