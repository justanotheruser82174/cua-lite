#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""In-container command server for the exec-stdio transport (sandbox family).

Runs INSIDE the env container on ``/opt/env/venv/bin/python`` and is reached
over ONE persistent ``docker exec -i`` pipe (not a network port).
Protocol: one JSON object per stdin line in, one JSON object per
stdout line out — except ``screenshot``, whose result is framed as ``header\n``
+ raw PNG bytes (read with ``readexactly``, not a JSON line). Multi-MB base64
responses (``read_bytes``/``write_bytes``) still ride one line, so the host
reader must raise its stream limit — see client.py.

Maintained images bake this file at ``/opt/lite/stdio_server.py``; client.py
execs that baked copy with the env Python. Production host↔container traffic
does not copy repo source into the container at runtime. Local protocol tests
may execute the repo copy directly under ``_local=True``. Missing baked files
or stale protocol versions are image freshness / install bugs.

Ops (request ``{"id": n, "op": <name>, ...}`` → response
``{"id": n, "ok": true, "result": {...}}`` or ``{"ok": false, "error": str}``):

- ``ping``        → {version, pid, pgid}         (liveness + version + the
      in-container identity the host's reap targets; pid/pgid are additive and
      absent from images baked before them — see :func:`op_ping`)
- ``run_command`` {cmd}                          → {stdout, stderr, returncode}
      Session context: every run_command child inherits the GNOME session bus by
      exporting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS (read from /tmp/dbus-session-bus-address)
      + GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge — gsettings/dconf, notifications, AT-SPI all
      depend on it. We re-read the marker per call (cheap; robust to session
      restarts). DISPLAY/HOME ride the image env.
- ``screenshot``  {}                             → raw PNG bytes (``header\n`` + body frame, not a JSON line)
      ffmpeg x11grab on $DISPLAY (in the base image); ImageMagick ``import``
      fallback (no xwd/scrot in the image).
- ``input``       {action, ...}                  → {}
      xdotool (XTest) on $DISPLAY: type / key / keydown / keyup / click /
      move / mouse_down / mouse_up / scroll. xdotool resolves keysyms
      directly over XTest, with no "pagedown"-alias key-mapping bug.
- ``read_bytes``  {path}                         → {b64}
- ``write_bytes`` {path, b64}                    → {}
      (used by osworld dispatch.py:638 / eval runner.py:1544)
