"""Docker image freshness: refuse to launch a container whose image is stale.

A container's image can silently fall behind its Dockerfile/patches after an edit
you forgot to rebuild. ``ContainerImage.ensure_runnable()`` (called from the launch
helpers in ``lite.gym.utils.backend.docker``) recomputes a hash of the build SOURCES and
compares it to the ``lite.src_hash`` label the image's install.sh stamped via the
same hash, so build and launch can't drift. See /docs/envs.md#image-build-and-freshness.

# ─── THE RULE for what belongs in a spec's ``sources`` ───────────────────────
# Hash a file IFF its CONTENT can change what ends up INSIDE the image.
#
# The two failure directions are NOT symmetric, so the rule is applied
# asymmetrically when a file is arguable:
#   * over-hashing (a file that cannot change the image)  → a spurious rebuild.
#     Annoying, never wrong.
#   * under-hashing (a file that CAN change the image)    → a STALE image reports
#     FRESH and silently runs forever. This is the failure this module exists to
#     prevent. When in doubt, INCLUDE.
#
# ``scripts/install.sh`` — READ THIS BEFORE "OPTIMIZING" IT OUT.
# An install.sh is a hash input for exactly one reason: some of them ASSEMBLE THE
# BUILD CONTEXT (stage/download/generate the files docker then COPYs) or pass
# build-args, so their content literally decides image contents.
#
# It is TEMPTING to drop install.sh from a hash because most of an install.sh is
# host-side orchestration (pip-installing host verifier deps into the repo venv,
# mode dispatch, pull/push, freshness probes), and editing that re-stales every
# image the script builds — 40 of them for cuaworld — for zero image change. That
# cost is real, but dropping the file is the UNDER-hashing direction: it would
# also stop catching an edit to the staging list a few lines away, i.e. exactly a
# silent-stale. The correct way to make an env quiet is to move the host-only code
# OUT of install.sh into a sibling helper that is not a hash input — never to stop
# hashing a script that stages the build context.
#
# Do NOT add host-only files (host verifier deps, task catalogs, evaluators,
# configs read at run time) as sources — none of them can change image contents,
# and each one buys a permanent stream of spurious full rebuilds. Importers are
# host-only unless they generate baked build-context inputs; CUAGym is the
# exception: CUA-Gym's importer produces apps.txt, which decides which mocks are
# staged into the image, so its env-local spec hashes that importer surface.
#
# When a source is a DIRECTORY, the same rule applies member by member, and the
# lever is ``exclude`` — NOT dropping the directory. Keeping the directory listed
# means a newly added file is hashed by default (over-hash, safe); naming its
# individual members instead would make a new stager silently unhashed. CUAGym's
# spec does this: ``scripts/utils`` stays a source, with its two host-only
# members excluded and the reason recorded per file.
