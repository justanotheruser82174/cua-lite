"""Async rollout driver + batch assembly for CUA-Lite RL training (GRPO, REINFORCE, etc.).

Drives multi-turn agent rollouts in the env (``generate``), orchestrates the
concurrent rollout / eval loops with cooperative abort (``generate_rollout``),
and assembles the surviving trajectories into slime's train_data dict
(``bucket_trajectories`` / ``flatten_and_align``). The pure steps→Sample-span
packing lives in :mod:`lite.train.rollout.core.segmenter` (imported here);
prefix-extensional protocols can pack adjacent turns into one multi-span
Sample, while windowed/Markov protocols fall back to length-1 samples.

Key design decisions (vs geo3k unfold rollout):
  - Uses agent.sample() directly: the adapter handles multi-turn prompt
    construction, so we don't need manual context accumulation.
  - The agent returns a generic RL step stream: each step supplies rendered
    prompt text, ordered image_indices, response text, and response tokens; the
    segmenter owns prompt tokenization and radix packing.
  - Custom generate_fn: calls SGLang HTTP with return_logprob=True using "text"
    key (not "input_ids") to avoid image placeholder pre-expansion bug.
  - Env-based reward: set in generate(), skips slime RM pipeline.
  - Async envs: CUA-lite envs are async (Docker containers + browsers).

Internal module — not a slime entry point. The per-algorithm shims
(``lite.train.rollout.{grpo,reinforce,dagger,sft}``) bind ``generate`` /
``generate_rollout`` from here via ``core/__init__.py``.
