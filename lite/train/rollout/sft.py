"""VLM SFT rollout for CUA-Lite datasets.

Custom Slime rollout function. Reads the SFT parquet schema:

  processed_images : list[bytes | None]
                                    — PNG bytes for model-visible images and
                                      None placeholders for stored screenshots
                                      no step references
  steps            : list[struct]   — serialized LiteRLStep records (already
                                      tokenized at export; see
                                      lite.train.export.sft_tokenize). Each
                                      step carries prompt + ordered image_indices
                                      + response/response_tokens.
  metadata         : string         — Lite metadata provenance kept in the
                                      parquet, but not routed to this harness

Steps are tokenized **at export time** (``export_sft`` loads the processor via
``--model-id``, derives each step's prompt/response boundary with the model's
chat template, and stores a :class:`LiteRLStep`). So this rollout does NO
re-render: it just deserializes the steps into a :class:`LiteRLSample` and runs
it through the **same** :func:`build_segment_samples` radix path the GRPO /
REINFORCE rollouts use. Both training surfaces produce identical multi-span
``slime.Sample`` shapes under prefix-extensional protocols (qwen3_5 with
``history_n=∞``, qwen3_vl with ``full_history_size=∞``), so a length-K segment
trains on K assistant spans in one forward.

For non-extensional protocols (Markov, sliding-window, fold-mid-trajectory),
the segmenter falls back to length-1 segments.

The processor is still loaded here — ``build_segment_samples`` re-tokenizes
each step's stored ``prompt`` WITH its images to produce ``pixel_values`` and
the vision-expanded ``input_ids`` — but it never touches ``apply_chat_template``
(and thus never needs ``enable_thinking``): the rendered prompt string is frozen
in the parquet. The Nth ``image_indices`` entry supplies the Nth
processor-owned image slot in that frozen prompt; the rollout validates the
count before segmenting.

Slime config (in scripts/train/run_sft*.sh):
  --rollout-function-path lite.train.rollout.sft.generate_rollout
  --input-key steps                 -> sample.prompt = list[LiteRLStep struct]
  --metadata-key processed_images   -> sample.metadata = list[bytes | None]
  (the parquet ``metadata`` column stays provenance-only)
  (NO --apply-chat-template, --multimodal-keys — we handle everything here.)
