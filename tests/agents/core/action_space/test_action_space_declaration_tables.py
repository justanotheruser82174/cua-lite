"""Lints for the two action-space DECLARATION tables, over every registry key.

A family declares two tables on its action-space class, each spelled with the
family's own name::

    LITE_ACTION_NAME_TO_<FAMILY>_ACTION_VALUES        (wrapper families)
    LITE_ACTION_NAME_TO_<FAMILY>_PROVIDER_FLAT_TOOL_NAMES / _FUNCTION_NAMES
    <FAMILY>_ACTION_VALUE_TO_EXTRA_TOOL_NAMES         (wrapper families)
    <FAMILY>_PROVIDER_FLAT_TOOL_NAME_TO_EXTRA_TOOL_NAMES

They answer two different questions in the SAME native namespace: which native
spellings are canonical ACTIONS, and which native spellings are canonical EXTRA
TOOLS. That split is not derivable from the emitted schemas — on ``ui_tars@desktop``
the schemas for ``wait`` (an action) and ``finished``/``call_user`` (finish tools)
are byte-identical modulo name and description, and ``step_gui`` packs ``WAIT``
and ``ABORT`` into ONE ``Literal[...]`` on ONE ``@tool`` — so each family
DECLARES it. A declaration nothing checks rots, hence these four lints:

  * **lint 0** — every action-table KEY is a canonical action of the core set
    that registry key serves (desktop / mobile / point / bbox).
  * **lint 1** — every action-table VALUE appears in the family's emitted
    wrapper ``action`` enum OR in its declared ``_SCHEMAS``. A REAL disjunction:
    the qwen-style wrapper families satisfy only the first arm, the
    ``ui_tars`` / ``ui_tars_15_v1`` keys only the second.
  * **lint 2** — every extra-tool-table KEY satisfies the same disjunction.
  * **lint 3** — the two tables are DISJOINT in the NATIVE namespace: a native
    entry is either an action spelling or an extra-tool spelling, never both.

The tool-LAYER invariants (``get_tool_names`` vs ``get_tool_schemas``) are a
different subject and live in
``tests/agents/core/action_space/test_tool_layer_invariants.py``; this module
is the only registry-wide check of the declaration tables themselves.

Hermetic: registry construction and schema generation are pure Python (no model
download, no network).
