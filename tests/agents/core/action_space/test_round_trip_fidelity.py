"""The action-space round-trip invariant, for core families x canonical action.

    parse(serialize(x)) == x   OR   serialize(x) RAISED   OR   parse(serialize(x)) RAISED

A silent ``[]``, a substituted action, or a re-invented default means the model's
action reaches the environment as something else than it asked for. A loud raise
is an acceptable outcome for both legs: this repo's unknown-model-action policy
makes GPT/Claude strict-mode families that fail loudly rather than silently drop.

Four declared outcomes per ``(action-space key, canonical action)`` cell:

* absent from all tables -> the round trip must be EXACT (the default);
* in :data:`CANNOT_EXPRESS` -> ``convert_tool_calls_to_agent`` (the *to_agent*/
  serialize leg) must raise ``ValueError``, with a reason naming what the wire
  lacks;
* in :data:`DECLARED_GAPS` -> both legs succeed but the round trip diverges, a
  known and pinned lossy conversion. The test asserts the cell still diverges,
  so closing a gap forces a table edit;
* in :data:`RAISES_ON_PARSE` -> the *to_agent* leg succeeds (the wire can carry
  the action, e.g. as an opaque pass-through), but the *from_agent*/parse leg
  raises ``ValueError`` because the provider wire format it produced has no recognized
  native verb. This is GPT/Claude's strict unknown-action policy: an action the
  family's wire cannot spell fails loudly on parse instead of vanishing.

The structured ``convert_tool_calls_{to,from}_agent`` pair is not always the real
wire; the text-rendering families (ui_tars) are not covered here yet.

Provider-family splits live beside their model tests.
