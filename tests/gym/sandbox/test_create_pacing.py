"""``docker run`` pacing for the sandbox family: env-server only, never direct.

``SandboxBaseEnv._attempt_boot_computer`` holds the create slot only
``if self._env_id`` — i.e. only under an env-server — and
``docker_create_slot_async`` itself yields unpaced whenever no
:class:`AdmissionGate` has configured the semaphore. Both carve-outs are
DELIBERATE, and this module is the regression guard for them.

Direct mode deliberately has no host-derived default bound: it has no 503-retry
client, so a slot timeout there becomes a hard task failure rather than
back-pressure, and a direct-mode caller already bounds its own fan-out through
its own concurrency settings.

So the two things pinned here are:
  1. a direct-mode boot takes NO slot and installs NO semaphore;
  2. the env-server path still runs at exactly its configured capacity —
     neither below it (a throughput regression) nor above it.
