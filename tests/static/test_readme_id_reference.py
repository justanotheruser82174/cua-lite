"""The root README's id reference must match the live registries.

README.md's Quick Start carries a collapsed list of every ``--model-id`` and
``--env-id``. A hand-written list beside a registry drifts -- this repo has
already shipped a README whose agent-family section predated a live factory id
-- so this pins both.

Two shapes need undoing before comparison, because both exist to keep the block
readable rather than to describe the wire:

* Model ids are brace-expanded (``Qwen/Qwen3-VL-{2B,4B}-Instruct``), and are
  matched EXACTLY -- ``AGENTS`` is a closed hand-maintained list, so an
  unlisted id is a real omission. The summary line carries no counts: the
  family names a reader would search for are already in the "Any CUA" bullet
  and the two "Supported" sections, which are not collapsed.
* Env ids are matched by PREFIX. ``lite.cuaworld`` alone expands to 39
  per-application ids, and ``registered_env_ids()`` returns whichever leaves the
  importing process happens to have registered. Listing leaves would put 39
  application names in a README and would break on every new app; listing the
  family and asserting coverage is the invariant that actually holds.
