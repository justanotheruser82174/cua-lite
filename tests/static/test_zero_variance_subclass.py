"""Static guard: no NEW zero-variance ``ActionSpace`` / ``Tools`` subclass.

A *zero-variance subclass* is a class that inherits from a project base and
whose body — after the docstring — is empty (or bare ``pass``). It registers a
distinct key but contributes no behaviour, so the key could have been an extra
alternative in the parent's ``key=`` regex instead of a whole class.

This guards an architectural invariant rather than a shim, which is why it is
the one new guard test the convergence plan sanctions.

Scope is deliberately ``ActionSpace`` / ``Tools`` classes only. Registration-only
``*Agent`` classes (``class FooDesktopUseAgent(AutoAdapterAgent, key=...)``, 49
of them) are the intended shape of the agent registry, not a defect — including
them would make this gate meaningless.

The exemption list is checked in BOTH directions:

* a zero-variance class that is not exempt fails, so no new one can land;
* an exempt class that has since grown a body fails, so the list cannot rot.

Run:
    uv run pytest tests/static/test_zero_variance_subclass.py -q
